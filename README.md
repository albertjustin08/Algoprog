## Adding New Exercises

When adding a new exercise:
1. Create appropriate directory structure
2. Add the solution code with descriptive filename
3. Include comments in code explaining the approach
4. (Optional) Add a README in the directory with problem description and notes

## Language Support

- And others as needed

## Notes

- Solutions are personal implementations and learning materials
- Feel free to use these as reference for learning
- Always try to solve problems independently first before looking at solutions
