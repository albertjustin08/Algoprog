# SOCS Online Judge Problems

This directory contains solutions to problems from the SOCS online judge platform.

## Organization

Each problem should have its own directory with a descriptive name:
- `problem-name/` or `problem-id/`

## What to Include

For each problem directory, you can include:
1. **Solution file(s)** - Your accepted solution
2. **Problem statement** (optional) - As a comment or separate `.txt` file
3. **Test cases** (optional) - Input/output examples
4. **Notes** (optional) - Approach, complexity analysis, etc.

## Example Structure

```
online-judge/
├── array-sum/
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   └── problem.txt (optional)
├── binary-search/
│   ├── solution.c
│   ├── problem.txt
│   └── test_cases.txt
└── dynamic-programming-01/
    ├── solution.cpp
    └── README.md (approach explanation)
```

## File Naming

- `solution.c`, `solution.cpp`, `solution.java`, `solution.py` for the main solution
- `problem.txt` for problem description
- `test_cases.txt` for input/output examples
- `README.md` for detailed notes or explanation

## Tips

- Use meaningful directory names that reflect the problem
- Include your problem-solving approach in comments
- Keep track of problem IDs or URLs if available
- Note time and space complexity when relevant
