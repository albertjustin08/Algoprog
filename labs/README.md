# Lab Exercises

This directory contains exercises from AlgoProg lab sessions.

## Organization

Each lab session should have its own directory:
- `lab01/` - Lab 1 exercises
- `lab02/` - Lab 2 exercises
- `lab03/` - Lab 3 exercises
- etc.

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive names for your solution files:
- `problem_name.c` or `problem_name.cpp` for C/C++
- `ProblemName.java` for Java
- `problem_name.py` for Python

## Example Structure

```
labs/
├── lab01/
│   ├── hello_world.c
│   ├── sum_calculator.cpp
│   └── README.md (optional - lab description)
├── lab02/
│   ├── array_operations.c
│   └── sorting.cpp
└── ...
```

## Tips

- Include comments in your code to explain logic
- Add problem descriptions as comments at the top of files
- Keep solutions organized by lab session number
